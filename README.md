Demo project to build a basic HTML5 diagramming application with the http://www.draw2d.org

You need bower and grunt to build the Draw2D demo app.

Grunt runs on Node.js, so if you don't have npm installed already, go ahead and install it.

##To install Grunt's command line interface run:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

With the flag -g you installed it globally and now you can access it from anywhere on your system.

##Bower
Installing bower couldn't be simpler. Just go:
```
npm install -g bower
```
and you have it.

##Install dependencies for the Gruntfile.js
```
npm install
```

##Build the project
Just type:
```
grunt
```
and you find the result in the **dist** folder.
